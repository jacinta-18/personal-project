I'mma give it to her how she want it, yeah
Say she need that real on the real with no strings
You niggas so Pinnochio, she don't want no strings (no, no, no)
808 boomin', beat it up with no strings
I'mma give it to her how she want with no strings
Flip flop on her, baby, yeah, no strings
You niggas so Pinnochio, she don't want no strings
808 boomin', beat it up with no strings
I'mma give it to her how she want with no strings
She say she need the real, I just say I need a freak
Hit it no strings, I just pull her by the weave
Lil' lean up in a liter, I just put her back to sleep
Late Saturday night, she might feel it for a week
Move that body 'round, she my puppet in the sheets
Legs up, I just eat it like it Philippe
Ain't no need for lingerie, girl, you already told the secret
Got you open like a book, know what you like, know how to read
You know where to reach me
I know you missed it, lookin' for that repeat
Throw you on that counter, on that marble, so Venetian
Call me daddy, screamin' Jesus, baby papa was a preacher
Say she need that real on the real with no strings
You niggas so Pinnochio, she don't want no strings (no, no, no)
808 boomin', beat it up with no strings
I'mma give it to her how she want with no strings
Flip flop on her, baby, yeah, no strings
You niggas so Pinnochio, she don't want no strings
808 boomin', beat it up with no strings
I'mma give it to her how she want with no strings
Play you like a violin, with no strings involved
Swear she twenty-one and done seen it all
Got you tied up like my retro 4's
But ain't nobody gotta know, said
Baby, just pass me the lighter
High as a tide, you know what time it is
All them girls my side, never reply
Give 'em the Heisman, ai ah
She down for whatever that I like, that's my type
Might fuck around get you a first class flight to Dubai, ay
Say she need that real on the real with no strings
You niggas so Pinnochio, she don't want no strings (no, no, no)
808 boomin', beat it up with no strings
I'mma give it to her how she want with no strings
Flip flop on her, baby, yeah, no strings
You niggas so Pinnochio, she don't want no strings
808 boomin', beat it up with no strings

Just tell me where to go, baby, lead me in
Exhale, shawty, breathe again
Take another shot, that's a easy win
We been gettin' lit for no reason
Baby, just pass me the lighter
High as a tide, you know what time it is
All them girls my side, never reply
Give 'em the Heisman, ai ah
She down for whatever that I like, that's my type
Might fuck around get you a first class flight to Dubai, ay
